Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns? Theater is the most successful program to be funded, journalism is not a good program to start a kickstart for and May is the most successful month to get funds on kickstarter. 

What are some limitations of this dataset? There isnâ€™t an individual dataset on donations from specific contributors to create an accurate average donation column.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? We could create a stacked column bar graph that compares a country's success to failure rate or make a table with countries as the row label that compares successful, failed, canceled and live kickstarter programs.
